# Metadata tools and resources

There are many existing tools and resources that allow you to browse metadata for health datasets, and we list some of them here:

### [1] [Health Data Research Innovation Gateway](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/search?search=&datasetSort=latest&tab=Datasets) and the connected [Metadata Catalogue](https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live/)

- The metadata used as input for this `R` package `browseMetadata`

- It is "managed by Health Data Research UK in collaboration with the UK Health Data Research Alliance"

- It is "a search-engine or ‘portal’ to help you find health datasets that exist in the UK"

- "The datasets that are discoverable through the Gateway are from organisations in the NHS, research institutes and charities, which are part of the UK Health Data Research Alliance"

A related resource from HDRUK is the [Phenotype Library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org), "a comprehensive, open access resource providing the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for UK electronic health records." See also the [Concept Library](https://conceptlibrary.saildatabank.com) developed by the SAIL databank team and collaborating organisations. 
    
### [2] [British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre (BHF DSC) Dashboard](https://bhf-dsc-hds.shinyapps.io/cvd-covid-tre-dashboard) 

- It offers "an overview and interactive summaries of the datasets currently available through CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT within the secure Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provided by NHS England for England, the National Data Safe Haven for Scotland and the SAIL databank for Wales"

- This dashboard allows you to explore data dictionaries, data coverage and data completeness.

### [3] [Office for National Statistics (ONS) Secure Research Service (SRS) Metadata Catalogue](https://ons.metadata.works/)

- Metadata for datasets within the ONS SRS. It is possible to filter for datasets related to 'Health' by clicking this tag on the first page.
