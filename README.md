# About `browse-SAIL`

As the name suggests, this repository was created to help a researcher browse the datasets in the [SAIL databank](https://saildatabank.com). It is intended to be useful at the *earlier* stages of a project, where datasets are being scoped out. When a researcher has not got access to the data yet they can still browse the meta data, and start to address such questions as:

:question: what datasets are available?

:question: what datasets do I need for my research question?

:question: which variables within these datasets map onto my domains of interest (latent concepts)?

## What does the R package do?

This R package is a planning tool, designed to be used alongside other tools and sources of information about health datasets for research. 

If a researcher wants to access datasets within SAIL databank, how do they know which variables will be represent the concepts they care about for their research question? There is a lot of meta data already publicly available on the [Health Data Research Gateway](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/search?search=&datasetSort=latest&tab=Datasets) and the connected [Metadata Catalogue](https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live/). This demo package uses this meta data, loads it up into R, and gets the user to browse through each dataset and variable. The user is asked to categorise each variable into a domain related to their research question, and these categorisations get saved in a csv file for later reference.

ðŸš§ It is still in demo form and has only been tested on a limited number of metadata files.

## Beyond SAIL Databank 

In theory, this package should work for any dataset listed on the Health Data Research Gateway, as long as a json metadata file can be downloaded. In practice, it has only been tested on (a limited number) of metadata files for SAIL databank. 

## Getting started with meta data & concept libraries 
There are many existing tools that allow you to browse meta data for health datasets. These tools may be sufficient for you to address the questions listed above. We list some of these below. ðŸ“¢ Please request to add more if you think they should be listed here too.

### [Health Data Research Gateway](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/search?search=&datasetSort=latest&tab=Datasets) and the connected [Metadata Catalogue](https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live/)

> "a search-engine or â€˜portalâ€™ to help you find health datasets that exist in the UK"

> "The datasets that are discoverable through the Gateway are from organisations in the NHS, research institutes and charities, which are part of the UK Health Data Research Alliance."

The is the source of metadata for the R package in this repo `browse-SAIL`
    
### [BHF DSC Dashboard](https://bhf-dsc-hds.shinyapps.io/cvd-covid-tre-dashboard) 

> "an overview and interactive summaries of the datasets currently available through CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT within the secure Trusted Research Environments (TREs) provided by NHS England for England, the National Data Safe Haven for Scotland and the SAIL databank for Wales"

This dashboard allows you to explore data dictionaries, data coverage and data completeness.

## Getting started with this R package `browse-SAIL`

### Install 

Download/clone this repository to your computer.

Install required packages: `devtools`, `gridExtra`, `grid`, `insight`, `rjson`

Then in the R console run:

`library(devtools)`

`load_all("/path-to-repo/browse-SAIL/browseSAIL")`

`library(browseSAIL)`

### Example run through 
Run `?domain_mapping` in the R console to find the documentation.

Follow the example in the documentation. You don't need to provide any input data!

Remember to reference the Plots tab in R. The domains will appear in the Plot tab and give you the necessary context for the categorisations. 

When using your own inputs, take note that these domain categories will be added to your domain list:
- NO MATCH / UNSURE
- METADATA
- ALF ID
- OTHER ID
- DEMOGRAPHICS

### The log file output

Running the function will output a log file with your decisions. An example log file output is shown below (left) with the demo domain list that was used to create it (right). The name of the log file will contain the date and time stamp, as well as Data Class and Data Asset. The log file will contain initials of the person making the catergorisations, as well as metadata about the dataset. For each Data Element (variable) in the DataClass, the log file will contain a 'Domain_code' which labels this variable as mapping onto one or more of the domains of interest. Notice that some have been auto categorised - double check them for accuracy. More than one domain is allowed to map onto each variable.

The idea would be that this log file could be loaded up, compared across users, and used as an input in later analysis steps when working out which variables can be used to represent which domains.
