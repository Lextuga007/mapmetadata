# About 

This repo contains a demo R package, written to help the initial process of mapping domains of interest (latent concepts) used in research, onto variables found in SAIL databank. As in, if a researcher has access to datasets within SAIL databank, how do they know which variables will be represent the concepts they care about for their research question? There is a lot of meta data already publically available on the [Health Data Research Gateway](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/search?search=&datasetSort=latest&tab=Datasets) and the connected [Metadata Catalogue](https://modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live/). This demo package uses this meta data.
