**Metadata** is data that provides information about other data. Metadata is a useful way to record relevant information about datasets, to help users find the right data for their use case, and understand the data's history. Metadata does not contain the full content, like the data itself, but it describes features and properties about the data, making it easier to use.

Phrases with similar meaning are data **specifications** and **schemas**. 

A **data dictionary** can be a way of storing and sharing metadata, and often includes information such as:

- Data variable names
- Data types 
- Default values 
- Missing data indicators 
- Linkage with other datasets  
- Data quality flags
