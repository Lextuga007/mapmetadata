For installation, set-up and basic usage refer to the package [README.md](https://aim-rsf.github.io/mapmetadata/index.html) file. In this tutorial, you will find more context on package inputs, how to interact with package functions and interpret package outputs.

# Preparing for mapping

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aim-rsf/mapmetadata/main/inst/outputs/BAR_360_NCCHD_2024-12-19-14-11-55.png" alt="example bar plot showing number of variables for each table alongside counts of whether variables have missing descriptions"/>

This bar plot is produced automatically when you run the `[metadata_map](R/metadata_map.R)` function with the demo metadata file, which contains metadata about the **National Community Child Health Database (NCCHD).**

The bar plot shows us there are 13 tables in the dataset. The height of the bar indicates the number of variables in that table:

-   The ones with lots of variables (e.g. CHILD_TRUST) will take you longer to process (caveat: see HDRUK Gateway screenshot below)
-   Some tables (e.g. CHE_HEALTHYCHILDWALESPROGRAMME) have a lot of empty descriptions. An empty description means that this variable will only have a label and a data type.

It is important to note that this plot is only summarising *variable* level metadata i.e. a description of what the variable is. Some variables also require *value* level metadata i.e. what does each value correspond to, 1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Unknown. This *value* level metadata can sometimes be found in lookup tables, if it is not provided within the *variable* level description.

The bar plot can help you understand the scope of the dataset, but reference the HDRUK Gateway page for the fuller context. For instance, table descriptions are not included in these structural metadata files but they are included on the gateway:

For dataset NCCHD, used in the demo, the structural metadata was downloaded from <https://healthdatagateway.org/en/dataset/360>. Below, we include a screenshot of this page; a user must click on the 'Download Data' then 'Structural Metadata' in order to download the file. Please note, we are working on API integration with this package to streamline this for users.

It is recommended to view the descriptions of each table to give you more context on their contents and how to use them:

# Understanding mapping outputs

Running `[metadata_map](R/metadata_map.R)` will run this function in demo mode (as explained in the README) and generate four files in your project directory. 

By default, the demo mode processes the first 5 variables in a table. Running `metadata_map(demo_number = 20)` will process the first 20 variables in a table. 
Here you can [view outputs generated from this longer demo run](https://github.com/aim-rsf/mapmetadata/tree/main/inst/outputs/), which include:

-   **BAR_360_NCCHD_timestamp.png**
    -   The bar plot that opened in your browser. It will save as a .html file but you can choose the 'Download plot as png' option.
-   **BAR_360_NCCHD_timestamp.csv**
    -   The data that created this bar plot.
-   **MAPPING_360_NCCHD_CHILD_timestamp.csv**
    -   The mappings between variables in the CHILD table and the research domains.
-   **L-MAPPING_360_NCCHD_CHILD_timestamp.csv**
    -   The same mappings as the previous file, but saved in a longer format. See the argument `long_output = TRUE` in `[metadata_map](R/metadata_map.R)`. If `long_output = FALSE` was used, the long outputs can be generated by directly calling the `[map_convert](R/map_convert.R)` function. 
-   **MAPPING_LOG_360_NCCHD_CHILD_timestamp.csv**
    -   A log file that accompanies the MAPPING file, describing features of the session and the table processed.
-   **MAPPING_PLOT_360_NCCHD_CHILD_timestamp.png**
    -   A simple visual representation of the mappings, displaying the count of each domain code.

# Compare mapping

Running the function `[map_compare](R/map_compare.R)` will allow you to compare the mappings from two sessions, perhaps two different researchers. This function compares csv outputs from two sessions, finds their differences, and asks for a consensus, creating a new output file:

**CONSENSUS_MAPPING_360_NCCHD_CHILD_timestamp.csv**

# Beyond the demo: using a custom metadata input (recommended) 

Currently, the way to retrieve a metadata file that is compatible with this package is to:

1. Visit the [Health Data Research Gateway](https://healthdatagateway.org/en/search?type=datasets) website
2. Browse for the dataset you want, click on it to move to its main page
3. Click on 'Download data' button and select 'Structural Metadata'  
4. Rename this file to be 'ID_Name_Metadata.csv' with 'ID' and 'Name' being changed depending on the specific dataset download

The demo metadata file used in this package is [360_NCCHD_Metadata.csv](inst/inputs/360_NCCHD_Metadata.csv), with 360 being the ID given by HDRUK Gateway and NCCHD being the abbreviation for the dataset name (National Community Child Health Database).

Any metadata file in the same format as this download should work with this package.

Run `data("metadata")` to load the demo metadata into your R environment. 
This demo metadata is also included as a package file and is retrieved using the `system.file()` function:

```r
ncchd_metadata_csv <- system.file("inputs/360_NCCHD_Metadata.csv", package = "mapmetadata")
demo_domains_csv <- system.file("inputs/domain_list_demo.csv", package = "mapmetadata")
metadata_map(metadata_file = ncchd_metadata_csv, domain_file = demo_domains_csv)
```

# Beyond the demo: using a custom domain list input (recommended)

Run `data("domain_list")` to load the demo metadata into your R environment (you can also read the package file with `system.file("inputs/domain_list_demo.csv", package = "mapmetadata"`).

```r
data("domain_list")
print(domain_list)
1 Socioeconomic info
2      Location info
3     Education info
4        Health info
```
Change this csv domain file to be more specific to your research domains (sometimes called latent variables or concepts) as these are broad and generic categories for demo purposes. 

Any domain file input will automatically have 4 codes appended to the start of the domain list, so do not include these in your domain list:
- NO MATCH / UNSURE
- METADATA 
- ID
- DEMOGRAPHICS 

You should see these automatically appended domains as 0-3 in the [plot that R generates for your reference](inst/outputs/plots_tab_demo_domains.png) when you run `[metadata_map](R/metadata_map.R)`.

# Beyond the demo: using a custom lookup table input (advanced) 

Run `data("look_up")` to load the demo metadata into your R environment (you can also read the package file with `system.file("inputs/look_up.csv", package = "mapmetadata")`).

The lookup table governs the automatic categorisations. If you modify the default lookup file, ensure that all domain codes in the lookup file are also included in your domain file for valid outputs.

# Copying across tables

If you're processing multiple tables (i.e. in run one of `[metadata_map](R/metadata_map.R)` select table one, in run two select table two) save all outputs in the same directory to enable table copying. This feature will speed up categorisation and ensure consistency. 
If it finds other MAPPING files with the same ID_Name in the output directory, and they contain overlapping variables, it will automatically copy the mappings from this previous table to the current table.

```r
Selection: 4
ℹ Processing Table 4 of 13 (CHILD)

ℹ Copying from previous session(s): MAPPING_360_NCCHD_BLOOD_TEST_2025-02-13-15-40-58.csv
```
Instead of 'AUTO CATEGORISED' the note will say 'COPED FROM: BLOOD_TEST' but you always have the option to manually override this copying during your review, or turn it off altogether with the option `table_copy = FASLE`.
