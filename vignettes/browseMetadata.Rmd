# Getting started with `browseMetadata`

For installation, set-up and basic usage refer to the package [README.md](https://aim-rsf.github.io/browseMetadata/index.html) file. 

This page provides more context on how to interact with package functions and interpret package outputs.

## `browseMetadata()`

The json file contains information about the data asset, data class and each data element. In the metadata catalogue:

- *Data asset* refers to a *Dataset* (a collection of data, can contain multiple tables)
- *Data class* refers to a *Table* within a dataset
- *Data Element* refers to each *Variable* within a table

See [here](https://github.com/aim-rsf/browseMetadata/tree/main/inst/outputs/) for outputs generated from a demo run. 

- BROWSE_table html summarises the dataset and each table in the dataset
- BROWSE_bar html, pasted below, is a simple bar plot summarising the dataset
- BROWSE_bar csv file contains the data used to make this bar plot

![bar plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aim-rsf/browseMetadata/main/inst/outputs/BROWSE_bar_NationalCommunityChildHealthDatabase_(NCCHD)_V16.0.0.png)

We can see there are 13 tables in the dataset. 
The (numbers) next to table names correspond to the order in which they are shown to you in the `mapMetadata()` function. 
The height of the bar indicates the number of variables in that table:

- The ones with lots of variables (e.g. CHILD_TRUST) will take you longer to process when running `mapMetadata()`
- Some tables (e.g. CHE_HEALTHYCHILDWALESPROGRAMME) have a lot of empty descriptions. An empty description means that this variable will only have a label and a data type.

It is important to note that this plot is only summarising *variable* level metadata i.e. a description of what the variable is. Some variables also require *value* level metadata i.e. what does each value correspond to, 1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Unknown. This *value* level metadata can sometimes be found in lookup tables, if it is not provided within the *variable* level description. 

## `mapMetadata()`

Running the function in demo mode  will use the same demo json file as `browseMetadata()`: 

``` r
mapMetadata()
``` 

Demo mode only processes the first 20 variables (data elements) within the table(s) we select to process. 

You will be asked to label data elements with one (or more) of the numbers shown in the Plots tab [0-7]. Here we have very simple domains [4-7] for the demo run. For a research study, your domains are likely to be much more specific e.g. 'Prenatal, antenatal, neonatal and birth' or 'Health behaviours and diet'. The 4 default domains are always included [0-3], appended on to any domain list given.

ℹ Found 13 table(s) in this Dataset. Enter table numbers you want to process (one table number on each line):

```

For the purpose of this demo, type 2 to just process the CHILD table only. Leave the prompt on the second row blank and press enter.

To process multiple tables at once in the same session (e.g. CHILD, SIG_COND) include their numbers on multiple lines:

```         
ℹ Enter each table number you want to process in this interactive session.

1: 1
2: 13
3:
```

```

```

It will now start looping through the data elements. If it skips over one it means it was auto-categorised or copied from a previous table already processed (more on that later). For this demo, it will only process 20 data elements (out of the 35 total).

```         
ℹ 20 left to process in this session

ℹ 19 left to process in this session

DATA ELEMENT ----->  APGAR_1 

DESCRIPTION ----->  APGAR 1 score. This is a measure of a baby's physical state at birth with particular reference to asphyxia - taken at 1 minute. Scores 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low; 4-6 fairly low, and 7-10 generally normal. Field can contain high amount of unknowns/non-entries. 

DATA TYPE ----->  CHARACTER 

Categorise data element into domain(s). E.g. 3 or 3,4: 7

Categorisation note (or press enter to continue): your note here 
```

We chose to respond with '7' because that corresponds to the 'Health info' domain in the table. More than one domain can be chosen. Do remember that this demo has over-simplified domain labels, and they will likely be more specific for a research study.

You have the option to re-do the categorisation (and note) you just made, by replying 'y' to the question:

```         
Response to be saved is '7'. Would you like to re-do? (y/n): y
```

After completing 20, it will then ask you to review the auto-categorisations it made.

These auto-categorisations are based on the mappings included in the default [look_up.csv](https://github.com/aim-rsf/browseMetadata/blob/main/inst/inputs/look_up.csv). Type `get("look_up")` in `R`.

This look-up file can be changed by the user. ALF refers to 'Anonymous Linking Field' - this field is used within datasets that have been anonymised and encrypted for inclusion within SAIL Databank.

```         
     DataElement    Domain_code  Note
1    ALF_E          2            AUTO CATEGORISED
2    ALF_MTCH_PCT   2            AUTO CATEGORISED
3    ALF_STS_CD     2            AUTO CATEGORISED
6    AVAIL_FROM_DT  1            AUTO CATEGORISED  
19   GNDR_CD        3            AUTO CATEGORISED

ℹ These are the auto categorised data elements. Enter row numbers for those you want to edit: 

1: 
```

Press enter for now. It will then ask you if you want to review the categorisations you made. Respond Y to review:

```         
Would you like to review your categorisations? (y/n): y

      DataElement             Domain_code   Note (first 12 chars)

ℹ Press enter to accept your categorisations for table CHILD, or enter each row number you'd like to edit:

1: 8
2: 14
3: 
```

If you want to change your categorisation, enter in the row number (e.g. 8 for BIRTH_TM and 14 for CURR_LHB_CD_BIRTH).

It will then take you through the same process as before, and you can over-write your previous categorisation.

All finished! Take a look at the outputs:

```         
✔ Your final categorisations have been saved:
OUTPUT_NationalCommunityChildHealthDatabase(NCCHD)_CHILD_2024-04-05-14-37-36.csv
✔ Your session log has been saved:
LOG_NationalCommunityChildHealthDatabase(NCCHD)_CHILD_2024-04-05-14-37-36.csv
✔ A summary plot has been saved:
PLOT_NationalCommunityChildHealthDatabase(NCCHD)_CHILD_2024-04-05-14-37-36.png
```
The OUTPUT csv contains the categorisations you made. The LOG csv contains information about the session as a whole, including various metadata. These two csv files contain the same timestamp column. If you do not like the formatting of the OUTPUT csv, see the function `?mapMetadata_convert_outputs` for an alternative. 

The PLOT png file saves a simple plot displaying the count of domain codes for that table.
