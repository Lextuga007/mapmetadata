Description: This package currently contains one function, domain_mapping
    This function takes two inputs which are a metadata file that has been downloaded in json format from modelcatalogue.cs.ox.ac.uk/hdruk_live
    and a csv file (created by the user, that lists research domains of interest. 
    The function will read in the metadata file for a chosen dataset, loop through all the variables, and ask the user to catergorise/label each variable as belonging to one or more domains. 
    The domains will appear in the Plots tab and information about the dataset will be printed to the R console, for the user's reference in making these categorisations. 
    A log file will be saved with the catergorisations made. To speed up this process, some auto-categorisations will be made by the function for commonly occurring variables; 
    these should be verified by the user by checking the csv log file. Example inputs are provided within the package data, for the user to run this function in a demo mode.
