Description: This R package allows researchers to explore publicly available 
  metadata from health datasets. It is a tool to help researchers plan projects 
  by interacting with metadata prior to gaining full access to health datasets. 
  At the early stages of a project, researchers can use this tool to browse 
  datasets and categorise variables.
