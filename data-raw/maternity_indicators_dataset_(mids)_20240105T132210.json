This can also include interventions to stimulate contractions after the waters have broken on their own (although some caregivers will refer to this as an induction).\n\nAugmenting the labour involves artificial stimulation of the contractions. This may be needed if the contractions have become weak, not coordinated (or irregular), far apart, not lasting long enough or have ceased for a period. If the labour needs augmenting, it means the contractions are not efficient enough to dilate the cervix.","lastUpdated":"2023-12-04T14:13:48.655Z","dataType":{"id":"bca6740c-db6d-4c7e-bf33-e41159a96859","label":"CHARACTER","lastUpdated":"2023-12-04T14:13:48.42Z","domainType":"PrimitiveType"}},{"id":"efca337f-7ab2-497b-b70a-c7a1fd844a90","label":"SUBMITTING_ORG_CD","description":"Submitting Unit Code (3 character code).
