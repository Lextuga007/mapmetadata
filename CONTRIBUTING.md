# Contributing to browseMetadata

We warmly welcome contributions to the browseMetadata project! 
This document provides guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug, please open an issue with a clear description of the problem and steps to reproduce it.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for new features or improvements are always welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas.

### Making Changes

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards and practices outlined below.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your feature branch to the main branch of the original repository.

### Coding Standards

- Follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) for R code.
- Write clear, readable, and maintainable code.
- Include comments and documentation as needed.

### Documentation

- Update the README or other documentation if necessary.
- Clearly describe the changes you've made and their benefits.

## Contributing to the R Package - author or reviewr of a PR

If your contribution involves changes to the R package itself (author or reviewer of a PR) here are some specific guidelines to follow:

1. Clone this GitHub repository and ensure all branches you need are up to date with remote.
2. Open up R Studio and ensure you have a **Git** tab in your workspace.
3. In this **Git** tab, move to the branch you want to make changes in (or review and test the changes of someone else).
4. Ensure that your current working directory is the R package directory you cloned (`getwd()` to check and `setwd()` to change).
5. Run `devtools::load_all()` in the R console. You should see `â„¹ Loading browseMetadata` returned.
6. Test the function runs by running `domain_mapping()` in the R console.
7. Make your changes (or review changes made by others), and commit these changes in the way you choose to interact with git locally!

If you run into issues with branches not seeming to be up to date in the R Studio workspace, consider running `remove.packages("browseMetadata")` and trying the above steps again, in case a previously installed package library is getting in the way somehow. 
   
### Working with Package Data

- **Creating .rda Files**: To create `.rda` files in the data directory of the package, use the following command in R:
  ```R
  usethis::use_data(dataname)
  ```
  Replace `dataname` with the actual name of your data.

- **Viewing Package Data**: To view the data included in the `browseMetadata` package, execute:
  ```R
  data(package='browseMetadata')
  ```

- **Loading Package Data**: To load specific data from the package, use:
  ```R
  data(dataname)
  ```
  Again, replace `dataname` with the name of the data you wish to load.

### Building Documentation

- **Generating Documentation Files**: To build the documentation files for the package, use the `roxygen2` package:
  ```R
  library(roxygen2)
  roxygenise()
  ```
  This will generate the necessary documentation based on your roxygen comments in the R code.

### Testing Your Changes

- Ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality. Run any existing tests, and consider adding new tests to cover your changes.

### Submitting Changes

- After making your changes, test them thoroughly.
- Update the documentation to reflect your changes, if applicable.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes and the benefits they bring to the package.
